## Fibonacci Sequence

Create a function that returns the first 20 numbers of the fibonacci sequence,
then use such function somewhere in your code. 

The function must return a list of integers containing the following numbers:

`0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181`

The numbers **can't be hardcoded**, they must be calculated.
