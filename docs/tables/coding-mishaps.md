| 5   | AI is the future, let ChatGPT implement the next piece of code for you, you cant change the code and must use it.                                                                                                              |
| 6   | VNIO: Variable naming is overrated, change a variable name to its acronym.                                                                                                                                                     |
| 7   | Methods are overrated, inline a function wherever it is used and then delete it.                                                                                                                                               |

| 10  | Pick a random non-string variable, its new type must be string.                                                                                                                                                                |
| 11  | Long file == Long D&D. One of your files must reach 1000 lines in the next minute.                                                                                                                                             |
| 12  | `snake_case` or `camelCase`? Why not both? rename a variable using a combination of both casing.                                                                                                                               |
| 13  | Dead code is the only safe code, write at least 30 lines of code inside a block that will never be called                                                                                                                      |
| 14  | Why use variables? When you'll need to add a new parameter to a function don't do it, just duplicate the function                                                                                                              |
| 15  | The next `if/else` should be converted to a `if/elseif`, also add a useless else with a TODO                                                                                                                                   |
| 16  | They told you not to negate if conditions, but.. replace if(!x) conditions with if(x) \{ nothing \} else \{ code \}                                                                                                            |

| 18  | For? While true! change a for statement to be a while true with a break inside a if to check the previous for condition                                                                                                        |
| 19  | Your code is boring, add at least 10 emojies in comments, variable names and function names                                                                                                                                    |
| 20  | Add an if in a random position of the code with an awful condition and add a comment inside it "if you find how to reach this point of code, please report it to this email: " and add a random email, then throw an exception |
| 21  | Insult someone in the code, replace a variable/function/class name with an insult (e.g. YourMommaSoFatClass)                                                                                                                   |
| 22  | Replace booleans with integers, if you have multiple booleans you **SHOULD** join them into a bitmask                                                                                                                          |
| 23  | Use two names that look like each other until you change font and/or re-read it a couple of times                                                                                                                              |
| 24  | If you are happy and you know it just throw an exception or two!                                                                                                                                                               |
| 25  | Take a random class and change all the method and variable names using the minimum number of characters, you are the minifier                                                                                                  |
| 26  | Randomly replace similar characters in names: IOInterceptor -> l01nterceptor                                                                                                                                                   |

| 28  | Keep your code nice and tidy: all lines with variable declaration must be together, sorted alphabetically, and with the same length                                                                                            |
| 29  | Don't trust the IDE: add a prefix or suffix to 5 variables with its type                                                                                                                                                       |

| 34  | Global is better! Get a random variable and make it globally scoped.                                                                                                                                                           |
| 35  | Versioning systems can't be trusted, create a backup copy of a few files in the same directory                                                                                                                                 |

| 42  | Create a variable "Answer_to_the_Ultimate_Question_of_Life_the_Universe_and_Everything", use it somewhere in your code.                                                                                                        |
